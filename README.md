Development status: pre-alpha

Dabble is a writing tool which breaks a document up into multiple sub-documents. This provides:

 * better organization
 * rearranging logical parts easily
 * easy navigation
 * keeping notes, research, and metadata together with the document

Existing applications exist like this. If Dabble doesn't work for you try using
[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php). Dabble is unique from Scrivener and other software in the
following ways:

 * Open source (free! as in speech and beer)
 * Web-based — use Dabble in the browser, on mobile, or on your desktop
 * Pluginable — plugins allow for extending the base editor, customize the document formats and editors, and adding
 additional tools
 * Smart — sub-documents and folders may have different views and editors based on their type, sub-documents may be
 linked to other sub-documents to create relationships for organization, and text content can be parsed an auto-linked
