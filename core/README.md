# Dabble Core

The core is all the data for a Dabble document. Dabble documents are at a basic level folders and pages. These can be
very customizable in editing and custom types of folders and pages allow for unique documents such as novels,
screenplays, research papers, etc.

### Document

Documents contain all of the text pertaining to a single project. This can represent a book, a series, a screenplay, a
research project, a white-paper, etc. The Document will also contain extraneous notes, research, and other items which
may not directly be included with the final output of your project.


### Folder

Folders are a general term that represent any node which contains children. A folder can be a book, a chapter, a folder,
etc.


### Page

A page represents any sub-document that is written on. It can be represented as an actual page or it can be displayed
as a scene, character sheet, index card, etc.
